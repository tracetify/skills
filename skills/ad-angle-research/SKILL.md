description: Pull the ads a competitor is running right now on Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and Google, then extract the hooks, offers, CTAs and landing pages worth modelling. Use when writing ad copy, planning creative tests, choosing a landing page angle, or when the user asks "what is X advertising", "what ads does X run", "find competitor ad hooks".

# Ad Angle Research

Turn a competitor's live ads into a short, sourced list of angles the user can test. The output is a creative brief, not a growth story: what they say, to whom, with what offer, where the click lands, and how long each ad has survived.

## Start with the decision

Confirm the competitor domain and what the user is about to make: ad copy, a landing page, a creative test plan, or a positioning check. If the user's own product and audience are unknown, ask once; otherwise state the assumption and continue. Keep competitor facts separate from the user's context throughout.

## Get the ads

**With the Tracetify connector** (tool names may be prefixed, e.g. `mcp__tracetify__research_competitor_ads`):

1. Call `research_competitor_ads` with the domain. It costs credits unless the same domain was queried within the last week; the tool quotes the price and the host asks for confirmation. Do not call it repeatedly for the same domain in one session.
2. Read the response as two independent sources. `meta` and `google` are each an array (checked), an empty array (checked, nothing running) or `null` (could not be checked). Never describe a `null` source as "no ads".
3. Use `summary` for counts, `earliest` for how long they have been buying, and `formats` for the mix. Each Meta ad carries `headline`, `body`, `cta`, `linkUrl`, `mediaUrl`, `platforms`, `start`, `end`, `active` and a `libraryUrl` you can cite. Each Google ad carries `advertiser`, `format`, `start`, `end`, `region` and a transparency-center `url`.

**Without the connector:** say so once, offer the one-line setup (`claude mcp add --transport http tracetify https://tracetify.com/api/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer <key>"`, key from https://tracetify.com/dashboard/ai, free account), then continue manually using [references/manual-ad-library.md](references/manual-ad-library.md). Do not stop the task because the connector is missing, and do not install anything on the user's behalf.

## Read the ads as evidence

Read [references/angle-extraction.md](references/angle-extraction.md) before summarising.

- **Longevity is the signal.** An ad that has run for months is one the advertiser kept paying for; a week-old ad is a test. Sort by `start` and treat the oldest active ads as the proven angles.
- **DCO/DPA ads** (`format` = `DCO` or `DPA`) are catalogue templates; their headline/body come from product feeds. Use their landing pages and product choice, not their copy.
- **Group by landing page.** Several ads pointing at one URL mean that page is the money page. Record the URL; the user can open it to see the offer and the proof the page relies on.
- **Separate claim from evidence.** An ad's claim ("sold out 3 times") is marketing copy. Do not repeat it as a fact about the business.
- **Platforms tell you the audience.** Threads/Messenger placements, Instagram-only, or Google Search-only each imply a different buying context.

## Deliver

Use [references/brief-template.md](references/brief-template.md). Lead with the two or three angles that have run longest, each with: the hook (quoted), the offer, the CTA, the landing URL, days running, the Ad Library link. Then list formats and placements in one line, the landing pages in a short table, and what could not be checked.

Suggest at most three tests for the user, each tied to one observed ad and phrased for the user's product, not the competitor's. State prerequisites the user may lack (a product feed for DPA, video assets for a VIDEO angle, a discount the user cannot afford to match).

Do not fabricate ads, fill a `null` source from memory, copy competitor copy verbatim into the user's draft, or imply that a long-running ad is profitable. Cite the Ad Library or transparency link beside every quoted line.
